# PyNgWallpaper - Coolest Wallpapers

### What pyngwallpaper does

Download the wallpaper offered by National Geographic photography website and set it current wallpaper background.

Another bash script for the same purpose can be found [here](https://github.com/genzj/ubuntu-ng-wallpaper)

----------

### Auto startup

#### Linux with Gnome
You just need to add a startup application:

    gnome-session-properties

then *add* a startup program with:

    Name: pyngwallpaper
    Command: /path/to/pyngwallpaper/src/main.py
    Comment: download and update wallpaper!

You can also append arguments in *Command* box.

#### Windows
Download [NgWallpaper-win32_1.0.0 here](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7095697/Releases/PyNgWallpaper-win32/NgWallpaper_1.0.0.exe) and unarchive it. A shortcut will be created in your startup folder if installed successfully. 

You can also create a shortcut by yourself, or add arguments to it.

### How it works

1.  Read and parse National Geographic photography *Photo of Today* [website](http://photography.nationalgeographic.com/photography/photo-of-the-day/)

1.  If there is a wallpaper download link:
    * if both its URL and target file name are same as last downloaded photos', exit without error
    * download it to the **specified** folder
    * record the downloading URL, location of saved photo and downloading time in a text file, which locates in current user's personal folder
    * use it as wallpaper unless in **download-only** mode
    * exit

1. If there isn't a wallpaper link, which means the photo may have  resolution improper to be a wallpaper:
    * if the **force** switch is on, do same as step 2
    * reduce **persistence** counter by 1; if it's 0, exit
    * go to the previous *Photo of The Day*, then do things again

                         [--setter-args SETTER_ARGS] [-t OUTPUT_FOLDER]

      -v, --version         show version information
      -d, --debug           enable debug outputs. The more --debug the more
                            detailed the log will be
      -f, --force           adopt this photo even if its size may be strange to be
                            wallpaper. Disabled by default
      --redownload          do not consider history records. Download must be
                            done. But this download will be recorded in history
                            file.
      -k, --keep-file-name  keep the original filename. By default downloaded file
                            will be renamed as 'wallpaper.jpg'. Keep file name
                            will retain all downloaded photos
      --persistence PERSISTENCE
                            go back for at most N-1 pages if photo of today isn't
                            for wallpaper. Backward browsing will be interrupted
                            before N-1 pages tried if either a downloaded page
                            found or a wallpaper link read
      -s {no,gnome3,gnome2,win}, --setter {no,gnome3,gnome2,win}
                            specify interface to be called for setting wallpaper.
                            'no' indicates downloading-only; 'gnome2/3' are only
                            for Linux with gnome; 'win' is for Windows only.
                            Customized setter can be added as dev doc described.
